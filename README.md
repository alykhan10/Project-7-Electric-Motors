# Project 7: Electric Motors
# Maintaining a Desired Flow Rate through a Power Valve using Direct Current

● Implemented a controlled voltage source to modulate torque output of a DC motor with back electromotive force           
● Connected the rotational-electromechanical converter and gear box to a rotating valve via a lumped inertia block            
● Integrated a 1D-Lookup Table in Simulink to control flow rate while restricting valve rotation between 0 and 2π rad
